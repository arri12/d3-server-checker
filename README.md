What is the purpose of this?
=================

It's a very simple tool which identifies whether or not the server you are on in D3 is a laggy server. 

Workaround for the lag issue at hand on the EU D3 servers: http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/8324862587

Requirements
=================
1) A Windows PC with Diablo 3 installed

2) Java SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html


Usage
=================
1) d3-server-checker.jar or git clone the repository.

2) Run d3-server-checker.jar or compile and run Main.java with "javac Main.java" -> "java Main"

* Good server: http://screencast.com/t/Hu87n7pSBawc
* Bad server: http://screencast.com/t/ifPuzLlJPi6
* Unknown IP: http://screencast.com/t/UVZDNOmSry


Troubleshooting
=================
* You may want to read http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html to understand path variables and how to execute java/javac.
* Your system variables should look more or less like this:

* Careful not to delete the current path variables, only add new ones!

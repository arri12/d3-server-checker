What is the purpose of this?
=================

It's a very simple tool which identifies whether or not the server you are on in D3 is a laggy server. 

Workaround for the lag issue at hand on the EU D3 servers: http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/8324862587

Requirements
=================
1) A Windows PC with Diablo 3 installed

2) Java SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html


Usage
=================
1) Download "Main.java" (case sensitive) or git clone the repository.

2) Open command line prompt (cmd) .. find it in start menu or press windows key + r - type "cmd" - press enter

3) Use the cd command to get to the folder where you saved "Main.java"

4) Compile the code with "javac *.java" in cmd

4) Run the code with "java Main" in cmd
